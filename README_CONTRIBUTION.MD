🛡️ Aegis: Intent-Based Phishing Detection
Status: 🏗️ Infancy / Under Active Development (Building in Public)

Aegis is an open-source, privacy-first browser extension that uses Local LLMs to detect social engineering tactics in real-time.

🚀 The Mission
Modern phishing bypasses technical filters by using perfect grammar and legitimate links. Aegis adds a "Cognitive Layer" to your defense, scoring emails based on manipulation tactics rather than just blacklists.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React / Plasmo (Cross-browser Manifest V3)
Backend: FastAPI (Python)
AI Layer: Llama 3 (via Ollama/Local Inference)
Security: DNS/WHOIS reputation checks
🗺️ Roadmap
 Phase 1: Universal Extension Shell (Current)
 Phase 2: Local LLM Integration & Prompt Tuning
 Phase 3: Community-driven Threat Sentiment Dataset
